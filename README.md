**English** | [中文](README_CN.md)

**AerialClaw** is a personal AI agent framework for general autonomous aerial systems. The system provides a standardized library of atomic action skills (takeoff, navigation, perception, etc.), with an LLM performing real-time environmental perception, decision planning, and skill composition during task execution — eliminating the need to pre-script complete flight procedures for each mission, while endowing each drone with its own identity, task memory, and skill evolution capability.

The project uses Markdown documents to define and maintain each agent's cognitive state and capability boundaries, autonomously read and written by the model — making every drone truly "personal" with its own experience, preferences, and growth trajectory.

> *"No pre-scripted procedures, just defined capabilities — let every drone think, learn, and grow through its own missions."*

## Motivation

Current drone systems mostly rely on pre-programmed scripts, lacking adaptability to unknown environments. AerialClaw explores endowing drones with **autonomous environmental understanding and real-time decision-making** through LLMs:

- 🧠 **Reasoning, not just execution** — LLM parses task objectives and generates step-by-step decisions
- 👁️ **Semantic-level understanding** — Multi-source sensor data converted to natural language for commonsense reasoning
- 📝 **Flight experience accumulation** — Task memory repository for history-based decision optimization
- 🪪 **Capability boundary awareness** — Performance profiles tracking capability boundaries

## System Architecture Design

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="AerialClaw System Architecture" width="900" />
</p>

### Core Design Principles

1. **First-person decision perspective** — Drone's own perspective for decision-making
2. **Semantic-level sensor fusion** — Raw sensor data converted to LLM-understandable descriptions
3. **Document-driven skill definition** — Actions and strategies as readable documents, dynamically loaded
4. **Hierarchical memory management** — Long-term experience and short-term context balanced efficiently

## Decision Mechanism: Autonomous Loop Implementation

The system employs an incremental decision mechanism based on real-time perception, executing a complete cognitive cycle at each step:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/decision_loop.png" alt="Autonomous Decision Loop" width="600" />
</p>

The system possesses basic exception handling capabilities: path replanning when obstructed, attention adjustment when discovering unexpected targets, and automatic return when battery is low.

### Identity and State Management System

| Document | Functional Description | Content Example |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `robot_profile/SOUL.md` | Defines decision preferences and constraints | *Safety-first strategy, conservative risk assessment* |
| `robot_profile/BODY.md` | Records hardware configuration and performance parameters | *Sensor types, flight performance boundaries* |
| `robot_profile/WORLD_MAP.md` | Builds environmental feature knowledge base | *Landmarks and risk points in known areas* |

Runtime experience and skill-statistics files are generated during experiments and intentionally excluded from the public repository. This keeps the repository package clean while preserving the mechanism that can create those files locally.

### Integrated Skill System

The system uses a **two-layer skill architecture** — hard skills handle all atomic operations, soft skills provide strategic composition:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/skill_architecture.png" alt="Skill Architecture" width="700" />
</p>

**Hard Skills (16 Atomic Operations)** — All directly executable actions:

| Category | Skills | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Flight Control | `takeoff` `land` `hover` `fly_to` `fly_relative` `change_altitude` `return_to_launch` | Takeoff/landing, hover, point-to-point flight, relative movement, altitude change, RTL |
| Perception | `look_around` `detect_object` `fuse_perception` | Multi-directional observation, object detection (VLM), multi-sensor semantic fusion |
| Status Query | `get_position` `get_battery` | Current position and battery status |
| Markers | `mark_location` `get_marks` | Mark points of interest, query marked locations |
| Computation | `run_python` `http_request` `read_file` `write_file` | Sandboxed code execution, HTTP requests, file I/O |

Hard skills include both physical drone control and information processing capabilities — e.g., checking weather APIs before deciding flight paths, or computing optimal routes using Python. All hard skills have built-in safety mechanisms: `run_python` runs in auto-degrading sandbox (Docker → subprocess → restricted), `http_request` blocks internal network with enforced timeout, file operations are restricted to working directory with audit logging.

**Soft Skills (Strategy Documents)**:

| Strategy | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `search_target` | Area search — LLM autonomously plans search paths, fuses vision and LiDAR to identify targets |
| `rescue_person` | Personnel rescue — Full workflow from approach, assessment, marking to reporting |
| `patrol_area` | Area patrol — Strategic area coverage with continuous anomaly monitoring |

Soft skills are stored as Markdown documents. During execution, the LLM reads these documents to understand strategic intent and autonomously composes motor, cognitive, and perception skills to complete tasks. The system also supports **dynamic soft skill generation**: when the LLM identifies recurring behavior patterns during reflection, it automatically extracts them into new strategy documents.

We are also exploring the use of a **Skill Network to model soft skill composition and scheduling**, evolving strategy selection from pure LLM reasoning toward a learnable, optimizable decision network. Looking further ahead, we aim to decouple AerialClaw's core architecture into a **general-purpose framework for intelligent devices** — through a standardized protocol adaptation layer, any hardware with sensing and actuation capabilities could gain the same autonomous intelligence.

### Perception System

Skill execution depends on environmental awareness. The system adopts a **passive + active dual-layer perception architecture**, providing the LLM with environmental information at different granularities:

- **Passive perception** (`PerceptionDaemon`) — Runs continuously in the background, periodically fusing multi-sensor data into environmental summaries for real-time situational awareness
- **Active perception** (`VLMAnalyzer`) — Triggered on-demand by the LLM, invoking vision-language models for deep image analysis (object detection, scene understanding, etc.)

Perception models are **plug-and-play configurable**: connect to cloud APIs (GPT-4o, etc.), locally deployed open-source models, or custom fine-tuned models — adapting to different deployment scenarios' requirements for latency, accuracy, and privacy.

This design supports research across various application scenarios:
- 🏚️ **Disaster Response** — Personnel search and rescue in rubble environments
- 🌲 **Ecological Monitoring** — Anomaly detection in forested areas
- 🏗️ **Facility Inspection** — Safety inspection of building structures
- 🌾 **Agricultural Observation** — Assessment of crop growth status

## Simulation Demo Environment

Currently verified in **AirSim + OpenFly** simulation environment (Shanghai urban scene):

  <br>
  <em>Autonomous flight in Shanghai urban scene — AI-driven navigation through high-rise buildings with real-time perception</em>
</p>

| Component | Technical Choice |
|-----------|------------------|
| Flight Control System | AirSim SimpleFlight (API-based control) |
| Simulation Environment | Unreal Engine 4 + OpenFly AirSim (Shanghai urban scene) |
| Sensor Models | Front camera + simulated LiDAR (360°) |
| LLM / VLM | GPT-4o (planning, perception, report generation) |
| Communication Protocol | AirSim RPC (pure-socket msgpack) |
| Coordinate System | NED (North-East-Down) local coordinate system |

**Simulation Scene Elements**: High-rise commercial district, mid-rise residential blocks, low-rise buildings, urban roads, open areas for takeoff/landing.

## Web Monitoring Interface

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/ui_overview.png" alt="AerialClaw Web Control Interface" width="720" />
</p>

Provides necessary visualization and interaction tools for research:
- 📷 **Multi-view Video**  — Real-time feeds from front/back/left/right/down cameras
- 📡 **LiDAR Visualization** — Multi-layer rendering of 3D LiDAR point cloud data
- 🕹️ **Manual Control**     — First-person view with keyboard flight control
- 🤖 **AI Autonomous Mode** — Natural language tasking with LLM-driven execution
- 💬 **Command Interface**  — Natural language task commands and dialogue
- 📊 **Status Monitoring**  — Real-time flight parameters and system status
- ⚙️ **Model Configuration** — Switch and configure multiple LLM backends

The system supports **real-time Manual / AI mode switching**, allowing operators to take over control from AI autonomous mode at any time, with one-click execution interruption. This is the fundamental safety guarantee for real-world deployment — AI handles the decisions, but humans always retain the final override.

## Installation and Deployment

This README gives two entry levels: a lightweight mock path for quick UI/API checks, and the full PX4 + Gazebo research-demo path for showcasing autonomous aerial operation with simulator sensors and LLM-driven flight. The simulator path includes a guided script plus a dedicated setup guide because it depends on host OS packages, graphics drivers, PX4 SITL, and Gazebo.

### Runtime modes

| Runtime mode | Purpose | README status |
|---|---|---|
| **Container mock** | Fast demo and UI/API smoke test with a prebuilt image | Verified path |
| **Local mock** | Source checkout development without an external simulator | Verified path |
| **PX4 + Gazebo full simulator** | Research demo with SITL flight, camera/LiDAR bridge, and AI mode | Main showcase path; run the guided setup on the simulator host |

### 1. Container mock mode — verified quick start

This path does not require PX4, Gazebo, AirSim, a GPU, a real drone, an LLM API key, or local image building.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XDEI-Group/AerialClaw.git
cd AerialClaw
docker compose up
```

Equivalent plain Docker command:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 5001:5001 xdei/aerialclaw:mock
```

Verify in another terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/status
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:5001
```

Developer-only local image build fallback:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.build.yml up --build
```

### 2. Local mock mode — verified development path

Use this path when editing the source tree without connecting to an external simulator.

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XDEI-Group/AerialClaw.git
cd AerialClaw

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest
python -m pytest

cd ui
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

SIM_ADAPTER=mock python server.py
```

Verify in another terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/status
```

Optional repository smoke gate for Unix-like shells:

```bash
bash scripts/smoke_mock.sh
```

#### Windows local mock notes

The repository includes a PowerShell smoke script for Windows users:

```powershell
.\scripts\smoke_mock.ps1
```

Use this path from a normal Windows Python/Node environment after installing Python 3.10+ and Node.js. If a Windows checkout changes shell-script line endings, `.gitattributes` keeps repository shell scripts configured for LF on subsequent clean checkouts.

### 3. PX4 + Gazebo full simulator mode — research demo path

Use this path when you want the complete showcase: AerialClaw Web UI, PX4/Gazebo SITL, sensor-enabled UAV model, camera/LiDAR bridge, and LLM-driven autonomous flight.

First run on a simulator host:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XDEI-Group/AerialClaw.git
cd AerialClaw
./scripts/sim_quickstart.sh --setup
```

Later runs:

```bash
./scripts/sim_quickstart.sh
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:5001
```

The default simulator demo uses `urban_rescue` + `x500_lidar_2d_cam`. After the UI opens, initialize the system, check the cockpit/camera panels, configure an LLM provider, switch to AI mode, and try a natural-language flight command.

Detailed simulator setup, health checks, camera troubleshooting, and LLM/VLM configuration are in [docs/SIMULATION_SETUP.md](docs/SIMULATION_SETUP.md).

The heavier Gazebo Compose entry is kept separate from the default mock path:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.gazebo.yml config
```

### Optional LLM configuration

Mock mode and the basic Web console can run without an LLM API key. For autonomous natural-language planning, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure an OpenAI-compatible provider:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit ACTIVE_PROVIDER, LLM_BASE_URL, LLM_API_KEY, LLM_MODEL
```

Supports OpenAI, DeepSeek, Moonshot, local Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible API. See [docs/LLM_CONFIG.md](docs/LLM_CONFIG.md) for details.

## Quick Start

After starting either Docker mock, local mock, or PX4/Gazebo mode, open:

```text
http://localhost:5001
```

In the Web UI:
1. Click "⚡ Initialize System"
2. Switch to "🤖 AI" mode (top right) when an LLM is configured, or use manual/mock controls for smoke testing
3. Try commands such as:
   - *"Take off to 15 meters and observe the surroundings"*
   - *"Search the northern area, photograph any targets found"*
   - *"Report current battery and position"*
